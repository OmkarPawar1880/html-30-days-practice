# 📅 Day 02 – Headings & Paragraphs in HTML

## 📌 Topic
**Headings & Paragraphs**

Today, I focused on understanding how content is structured in HTML using headings and paragraphs. These elements are the backbone of readable, well-organized web pages and are essential for accessibility and SEO.

## 🎯 What I Learned
- How to use all heading levels from **`<h1>` to `<h6>`** correctly
- How to structure content like a blog article using headings
- How to write meaningful paragraphs using the **`<p>`** tag
- When to use **line breaks (`<br>`)** and **horizontal rules (`<hr>`)**

## 🧪 Practice Questions

1. Create a webpage that uses **all heading levels (`h1`–`h6`)** in the correct order.
2. Write a **blog-style article** using headings and paragraphs for:

3. Add **line breaks** inside a paragraph where needed.
4. Use a **horizontal rule** to separate different sections of content.

## 🛠 Mini Project – Blog Post Layout

### Project Description
I created a simple **blog post layout** using proper heading hierarchy and paragraph structure.  
The goal was to make the content:
- Easy to read
- Well organized
- Semantically correct

### Features
- One main heading (`h1`) for the blog title
- Subheadings (`h2`, `h3`) for sections
- Paragraphs for detailed content
- Line breaks and horizontal rules for better spacing and clarity

## ✅ Key Takeaway
Headings are not just for styling — they define the **structure and meaning** of a webpage. Using them properly makes content more accessible, SEO-friendly, and professional.
